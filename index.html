	<div style="font-family: courier">
	<P> My name is Katherine Smith. I was born and raised in 
	<i><A href= "https://www.augustaga.gov/"> Augusta, Georgia </a>: </i>
	a town known for the Masters Golf Tournament and not much else. It was always a town people
	descibed as "a town that everyone complains about, but no one ever leaves." It will 
	always be home to me. Growing up, I a very active kid and it was a rare occasion if
	I was not outside. I played soccer since I could walk, was a competitive 
	<i><A href = "http://www.augustachronicle.com/newstimes/life/2013-10-16/greenbrier-wins-its-third-straight-volleyball-crown"> volleyball </a> </i>
	player in high school. In addition to sports, I also had another passion: school. I always 
	excelled in school and genuinely enjoyed learning and growing. My favorite subject was always 
	math, with science as a close second. Because of this, my college major will come as 
	no surprise. </P>
<P> I graduated high school in May of 2014, and was very eager to start my college career at
The University of Georgia. I always knew I had an interest in the medical field; however, I was
a little weary of dealing with the emotional side of working in a clinical setting as a doctor.
This is why I decided against a pre-med track and chose to major in biomedical engineering. 
 In my 3rd year at the University, I decided to add on a certificate in computer science to give
myself another skill and to open more doors in my career path journey.  </P>
<P> As one could probably imagine, my college journey has been one with many struggles, many tears,
and an unimaginable amount of stress. It also has given me a lot of smiles, life-long friendships, 
and unforgetable experiences. Most importantly, my time at UGA has given me a newfound sense of 
confidence that I am capable and competent to do what I set my mind to. Although my journey is not
yet finished, I cannot wait to see what my last year at UGA will bring me and what my future will 
hold.
